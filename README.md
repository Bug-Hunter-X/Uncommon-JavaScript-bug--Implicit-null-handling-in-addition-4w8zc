# Uncommon JavaScript Bug: Implicit Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to null value handling during addition. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers, but its null handling is incomplete, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description
The original `foo` function handles cases where one of the input parameters (`a` or `b`) is null. However, it doesn't explicitly address the scenario where *both* parameters are null.  While JavaScript's loose typing might appear to handle this implicitly, it's better practice to explicitly handle all possible null cases to prevent unexpected behavior and improve code clarity. 

## Solution
The solution provides an updated `foo` function which explicitly checks for the case where both `a` and `b` are null, returning a clearly defined value (0 in this case). This avoids any implicit behavior and enhances the function's robustness.
